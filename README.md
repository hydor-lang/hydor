# Hydor

A statically-typed, bytecode-compiled programming language.

## Overview

Hydor is a programming language that compiles to portable bytecode, allowing you to compile once and execute anywhere.
Currently in early development.

## Features

- **Static Typing** - Type safety at compile time
- **Bytecode Compilation** - Compile to portable bytecode format
- **Cross-platform Execution** - Run Hydor bytecode file (`.hydc`) on any platform with the runtime

## Current Status

⚠️ **Early Development** - Hydor is currently in active development. Much more to come!

## Getting Started

_Coming soon - Installation and usage instructions will be added as the language develops._

## Roadmap

Future plans include:

- Control flow structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and procedures
- Standard library
- More complete type system
- Optimizations
- Documentation and examples

## Contributing
